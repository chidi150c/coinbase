Please summarize all files, features, and processes we have created so far in this project into a single cohesive specification text (call it Text B).

This summary will later be merged into my invariant baseline, so it must be self-contained. Before you finalize Text B into my invariant baseline, verify a few details against my actual repo and stack to make sure the spec is 100% correct. Ask me to paste/upload what you need so you can cross-check:
