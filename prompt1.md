Please summarize all files, features, and processes we have created so far in this project into a single cohesive specification text (call it Text B). It must list paths, configs, env vars, new features, tools, and runtime processes. Do not paraphrase or skip details â€” include exact filenames, env keys, and ports. This summary will later be merged into my invariant baseline, so it must be self-contained.
