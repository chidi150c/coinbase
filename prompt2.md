“Here is baseline text A. Here is update text B.
Please integrate B directly inside A where it naturally belongs (not as a separate list).
Keep all of A’s original lines intact unless they must be expanded to fit B.
Do not delete or paraphrase A — if you must replace a line, show the removed text separately at the end.
The result must read as a single, seamless, stable specification.
In short: merge B inline into A, preserve all invariants, and return any dropped text at the bottom.”
