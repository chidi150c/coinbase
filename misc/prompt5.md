Distill the Merged Specification (A+B) into a single invariant project specification.
Output must be no longer than Text A.
Use a sectioned bullet-point format.

Keep every critical file path, env var, port, metric name, and runtime process.

Eliminate redundancy and explanatory prose.

Prioritize exact technical details over explanations.

The goal is a compact but complete baseline that can be used to prompt another AI to reproduce the current state of the project.
