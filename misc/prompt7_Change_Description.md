Help me write a CHANGE_DESCRIPTION for the code you want to modify based on our agreed items currently.

The CHANGE_DESCRIPTION must be:

A single, precise sentence.

Written in imperative style (e.g., “add…”, “update…”, “replace…”, “remove…”).

Contain only the specific change required, not surrounding context or extra steps.

Avoid vague words like ‘improve’, ‘enhance’, ‘fix’ unless paired with the exact element being changed.

Use the format:
verb + what is being changed + how/with what.

For example:

add client_order_id field to the /order/market payload

update RSI_PERIOD to be configurable via environment variable RSI_PERIOD with default 14

increment bot_stoploss_triggered_total counter when a stop-loss exit occurs

Generate the CHANGE_DESCRIPTION for: {{YOUR_DESIRED_CHANGE}}.
