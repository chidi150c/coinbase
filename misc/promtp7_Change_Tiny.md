Firstly, output a single-sentence CHANGE_DESCRIPTION: - Format: verb + what is being changed + how/with what. - Imperative style (e.g., “add…”, “update…”, “remove…”). - Describe exactly the code change required; avoid general context. - Avoid vague terms like “improve/enhance/fix” unless paired with the specific element being changed. - One sentence per item only. 

Secondly, Pause and verify required inputs. If ANY input is missing, ask me to provide it before writing code. - Examples of required inputs: - Source files: e.g., “paste current live.go / trader.go / strategy.go / model.go / metrics.go / config.go / env.go / backtest.go / broker*.go / bridge/app.py / monitoring/docker-compose.yml”. - Env/config values: e.g., “what Slack webhook URL?”, “what Docker base image?”, “list current /opt/coinbase/env/bot.env and bridge.env”. - External URLs/IDs (API keys should never be pasted in clear; ask me to confirm they are already configured). - Never guess; explicitly request missing files or settings.
