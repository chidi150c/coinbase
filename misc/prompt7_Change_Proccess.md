Generate a full copy of {{ws_binance.py}} with only the necessary minimal changes to implement {{add a best-effort retry wrapper and ≤2000ms success-only in-memory cache around the /api/v3/account call in bridge_binance/ws_binance.py for /accounts, /balance/base, and /balance/quote, without changing any JSON schemas, field names, numeric semantics, or other endpoints or trading logic}}. Do not alter any function names, struct names, metric names, environment keys, log strings, or the return value of identity functions (e.g., Name()). Keep all public behavior, identifiers, and monitoring outputs identical to the current baseline. Only apply the minimal edits required to implement {{add a best-effort retry wrapper and ≤2000ms success-only in-memory cache around the /api/v3/account call in bridge_binance/ws_binance.py for /accounts, /balance/base, and /balance/quote, without changing any JSON schemas, field names, numeric semantics, or other endpoints or trading logic}}. Fix any compile error(s). Return the complete file, copy-paste ready, in IDE.
