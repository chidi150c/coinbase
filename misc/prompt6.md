Now I want the distilled invariant baseline to be no longer than ≈[200] lines.
So,give me a version that’s ≤ [200] lines (say ~[190–200] lines) as long as nothing important is lost. 

The draft you gave expanded to ~[237] lines because it carried some redundant explanatory bullets and repeated details (e.g., env vars listed in multiple places, duplicated notes about long-only behavior, ports restated twice). The goal is a compact but complete baseline that can be used to prompt another AI to reproduce the current state of the project.

You can re-compress it by:

Removing redundancy (e.g., list env vars only once, not under both “env” and “features”).

Grouping sections (e.g., combine runtime/logs with bot features).

Collapsing prose lines into tighter bullet groups.

Keep every critical detail (e.g., filenames, env vars, ports, metrics, processes) but cut fluff.
