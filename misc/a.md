Generate a full copy of {{}} with only the necessary minimal changes to implement {{replace /candles handlers in bridge_binance and bridge_hitbtc with exchange-specific implementations that call Binance v3 klines and HitBTC v3 public candles respectively, pass through validated symbol/interval/limit, normalize times (ms for Binance; RFC3339 for HitBTC), remove Coinbase-style aliases, propagate upstream non-2xx responses, and log upstream URL/status/body snippet}}. Do not alter any function names, struct names, metric names, environment keys, log strings, or the return value of identity functions (e.g., Name()). Keep all public behavior, identifiers, and monitoring outputs identical to the current baseline. Only apply the minimal edits required to implement {{replace /candles handlers in bridge_binance and bridge_hitbtc with exchange-specific implementations that call Binance v3 klines and HitBTC v3 public candles respectively, pass through validated symbol/interval/limit, normalize times (ms for Binance; RFC3339 for HitBTC), remove Coinbase-style aliases, propagate upstream non-2xx responses, and log upstream URL/status/body snippet}}. Return the complete file, copy-paste ready.
