Generate a full copy of {{}} with only the necessary minimal changes to implement {{}}. Do not alter any function names, struct names, metric names, environment keys, log strings, or the return value of identity functions (e.g., Name()). Keep all public behavior, identifiers, and monitoring outputs identical to the current baseline. Only apply the minimal edits required to implement {{}}. Return the complete file, copy-paste ready.
